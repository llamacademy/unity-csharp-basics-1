# Unity Coding Basics Part 1 - Writing Your First Script

If you've been using Unity for a while, or are just getting started with Unity and decided it's time for you to start learning how to write code - this is the video you need to start your programming journey! 

In this tutorial repository (with [associated video](https://youtu.be/SXaa61JWLDw)), aimed at absolute beginners who have very little to no coding experience whatsoever, you'll learn:
* Installing Visual Studio to write code
* What is a "Script"?
* Creating your first Script
* What's going on with the default stuff in your new script?
* A step-by-step breakdown of what each statement is doing, why it's happening, and how it works.
* How to make numbers on the screen count up over time

**📝📝📝YOUR HOMEWORK!📝📝📝**

Create a new script that will show a random number between 0 and 1 and display that on a TextMeshProUGUI component, formatted to 2 decimal places.
Add a comment below with a video showing your code and the end result.
